# UAH Student Instructor Evaluations (SIEs)

A structured archive of Student Instructor Evaluations (SIEs) from my time teaching at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

This repository contains official semester-by-semester evaluation reports provided after final grades were posted and administrative review was completed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose

Teaching at UAH was not a career requirement — it was a personal commitment.

I chose to continue instructing while working full-time because I believe strongly in preparing the next generation of engineers with not just theoretical understanding, but demonstrated competency.

This repository serves as a transparent archive of that teaching effort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📘 Course Taught

I taught **EGR101 — Introduction to Programming for Engineers**.

The course focused on foundational computational and analytical skills using:

- MATLAB  
- Python  
- Microsoft Excel  

EGR101 serves as an early technical filter course within the engineering curriculum, establishing programming fundamentals, structured problem-solving habits, and analytical thinking skills that students carry forward into upper-level coursework.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Teaching Philosophy

My course was intentionally rigorous.

Students were expected to:

- Demonstrate conceptual understanding
- Apply programming to solve structured engineering problems
- Communicate technical reasoning clearly
- Develop discipline in analytical thinking
- Debug and validate their own work methodically

I was not an “easy A” instructor.

However, students who completed the course successfully demonstrated competency across multiple levels — conceptual, computational, and applied.

The goal was never to filter students out.

The goal was to prepare them properly.

## 📊 What This Repository Contains

- Semester-by-semester SIE reports
- Quantitative scoring summaries
- Anonymous qualitative feedback
- Institutional metrics

These evaluations:

- Are collected anonymously from students
- Are only released after final grades are submitted
- Are reviewed by the Dean of Engineering and administration before being provided to instructors

No editing or filtering has been applied to the official documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌟 Public Reviews

In addition to official SIE documentation, public student feedback can be found here:

Public reviews represent voluntary student commentary and are separate from official institutional evaluations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Instructional Scope

EGR101 emphasized:

- Programming fundamentals
- Logical flow control
- Data structures and arrays
- Function design
- Numerical computation
- Engineering data analysis
- Structured spreadsheet modeling

Students were evaluated on:

- Code correctness
- Efficiency and clarity
- Problem decomposition
- Debugging methodology
- Technical communication

The intent was to establish a professional standard early in the curriculum.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Outcomes

Across multiple semesters:

- Students who engaged consistently performed well
- Course rigor translated into measurable competency
- Feedback reflects both challenge and growth

The classroom environment emphasized accountability, clarity, and fairness.

Students were treated as developing engineers — not simply as test takers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📐 Professional Context

Teaching was conducted alongside full-time professional engineering work.

This allowed integration of:

- Real-world engineering problem framing
- Practical computational examples
- Industry-informed expectations

The classroom experience was designed to bridge academic theory with applied engineering practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Project Status

This repository serves as an archival record of instructional performance and feedback.

No ongoing updates are expected unless additional historical documentation is added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Note

Education is a long-term investment.

The value of instruction is not measured solely in semester averages — but in whether students leave better prepared than they arrived.

This repository reflects that effort.
